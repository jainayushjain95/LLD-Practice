The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create copies of
existing objects without making your code dependent on their concrete classes.

Instead of using the new keyword directly, the prototype pattern involves creating new objects by copying an existing instance.
This is particularly useful when object creation is complex or expensive.

Creational Design Pattern
It falls under the creational category because it deals with object creation by copying prototypes rather than instantiating new objects from scratch.

Efficiency:
    Copying an object using the prototype pattern can be more efficient than re-creating and reinitializing it from scratch,
    especially if object construction is resource-intensive.
